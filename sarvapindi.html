Sarva Pindi or Tapala Chakka is a traditional dish from the state of Telangana. It is mostly consumed as an evening snack. It can also play the same role as chapati (the traditional Indian bread) in any cuisine. Not only this, but even for breakfast Sarva Pindi serves as the perfect dish to serve. It is enjoyed by adults as well as children and can be a sneaky way to make kids finish their vegetables. In Telangana it is a common practise to add chopped vegetables such as cabbage, capsicum to the dough so as to make these vegetables a part of the savoury rice flour pancake. So, we can say that Sarva Pindi is a salty, delicious rice flour pancake that is easy to customise, easy to eat and easy to serve to the children.</p>
<p>
Sarva Pindi is a flavoursome pancake that is healthy in nature. Since it is made out of rice flour and not any other flour alternatives, it is gluten free and is perfect for people who like to stay on a gluten free diet. Hence, in a country like India where the kitchens are flooded with wheat and the gluten in it, Sarva Pindi or Tapala Chakka  holds a special traditional spot. It has a unique taste that is a perfect blend of all the spices and ingredients added to it. The mouth-watering essence of garlic at the back while the Chana and chilly take the front lead makes it really delicious and mouth-watering.
