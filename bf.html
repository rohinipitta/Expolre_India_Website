Basilica of Bom Jesus, Roman Catholic church in the abandoned city of Old Goa, Goa state, India. Built between 1594 and 1605, it is regarded as an outstanding example of Renaissance Baroque and Portuguese colonial architecture. The basilica is also known for housing the remains of the missionary St. Francis Xavier, who was based in Goa in 1541–49.
</p>
<p>
Old Goa was the original capital of the former Portuguese colony of Goa and once rivaled Lisbon in size and splendor. It was the first Jesuit colony in the Indian subcontinent and in 1565 could boast a population of 200,000. However, malaria and cholera epidemics ravaged the city in the seventeenth century and it was then largely abandoned.</p>
<p>

Construction of the huge Basilica of Bom Jesus (“Good Jesus”) began in 1594, and it was consecrated in 1605. It attained status as a basilica in 1946. Cruciform in plan, its facade combines Ionic, Doric, Corinthian, and composite styles. Three elegant entrances are surmounted by three large rectangular windows, then three smaller circular windows, culminating in a richly carved central gable.</p>
<p>

The chapel and tomb of St. Francis Xavier—a student and companion of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits—lie on the south side of the transept. The ornate tomb was a gift from Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany. Carved by Giovanni Battista Foggini, it was begun in 1689 and was erected in 1698. The silver-covered casket containing St. Francis’s remains is a magnificent hybrid of Italian and Indian art; a painstaking restoration was completed in 2021. When the saint’s body was transferred here a year after his death it was said to be “as fresh as the day it was buried.” St. Francis is credited with miraculous healing powers. His feast day, December 3, is observed every year, and his body is displayed to the faithful and carried in procession every ten years, attracting pilgrims from far and wide.</p>
<p>
The Basilica of Bom Jesus is among the group of “Churches and Convents of Goa” listed as a World Heritage site in 1986. In addition to being open to tourists, the basilica hosts mass daily</p>
