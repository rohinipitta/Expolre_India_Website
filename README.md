Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the mainpage.html page not displaying correctly, try the following steps:

Verify File Paths

Ensure that all files (images, CSS, etc.) are in the correct directories and that the paths specified in the HTML are accurate.

Check Network Requests

Open the browserâ€™s Developer Tools (Ctrl + Shift + I or Cmd + Option + I on Mac).
Go to the "Network" tab.
Reload the page (Ctrl + R or Cmd + R).
Check the status of network requests. Ensure that all resources (images, CSS files) are loading successfully without errors (status codes 404, 403, etc.).
Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes, clearing the browser cache or opening the page in an incognito/private window can resolve display issues caused by cached files.

Validate HTML and CSS

Ensure that the HTML and CSS syntax is correct. Use validators like W3C HTML Validator and CSS Validator to check for errors.

Test Across Browsers

Test the webpage in different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure compatibility and consistent display.

Check for Overlapping Elements

Inspect the page to ensure no elements are overlapping or hidden due to CSS styles.
