<p>In Andhra Pradesh, these fishes merge into the river water of the charming Godavari and thus bring in the sweetness of river water in them. Best enjoyed in a spicy gravy, this fish makes for the perfect lunch or dinner, thanks to its ability to absorb flavor and spices. Most importantly, don't let the idea of cooking with fish, This step-by-step guide will lead you in the right direction.</p>
<p>
This straightforward dish is enthusiastic about taste and simple to make. While similarly as delicious as the other two plans, what genuinely sets the Andhra style Pulasa Pulusu is the way that it's made with simple to discover fixings - indeed, you most likely have them all in your storage space at the present time.</p?>
<p>
During the monsoon season, the fishermen folk from the basins of Godavari and some of its tributaries expectantly await their prize catch. Pulasa, which is perhaps the costliest fish available in that belt, enters these rivers from the sea to lay their eggs in sweet water. In these areas, the fish sells at a princely price of few thousand rupees per kg during this time, being lapped up by rich and wealthy to enjoy Pulasa Pulusu, a rich gravy dish normally eaten with rice. In fact in the coastal areas, there is a Telugu saying â€œPustelu ammi ayina Pulasa which means that it is worth even selling your mangal sutras to have Pulasa fish.</p>
