  <p><u><b>HISTORY</b></u><br>
  Traditionally, Ahobilam is known as the location where Vishnu killed the rakshasa Hiranyakashipu in the form of Narasimha in order to save his devotee Prahlada. The legend says that to destroy the rakshasa, Narasimha emerged from a rock pillar. In a variety of murti in the different temples, the moment is portrayed. Garuda also prayed in the form of Avathara for a vision of Narasimha, to fulfil his wish, and settled across the hills in Ahobilam in nine forms.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p><u><b>Temple Legends</b></u><br>
  Scriptures and legends regard Ahobilam as the place where Vishnu took the mighty man-lion incarnation of Narasimha to destroy the demon Hiranyakashipu and protect the devotee Prahlada. Narasimha is also said to have emerged from a pillar, which is believed to be a rock found here.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p><u><b>Ancient Texts</b></u><br>
  As per ancient texts like Brahmanda Purana, Garuda, the mighty bird mount of Vishnu, did severe penance in these mountains for many years, to get the vision of the Narasimha form that destroyed Hiranya. At last, Garuda is said to have got the exhilarating darshan of Jwala Narasimha in all his glory, in a cave. The mountain range where Garuda performed the penance became Garudachala or Garudadri. As Garuda got Narasimha's vision in a big cave, the place itself got the name 'Aho Bilam,' the great cave.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p><u><b>The History and Architecture of Ahobilam Temple</b></u><br>
  The 9 Narasimhas enshrined in the Ahobilam temples are â€“ the Jwala Narasimha, Ahobila Narasimha, Malola Narasimha, Kroda Narasimha, Karanja Narasimha, Bhargava Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Kshatravata Narasimha, and Pavana Narasimha. These deities can be worshipped in their individual temples, situated amidst the mountain ranges of Ahobilam.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p>In addition to these, Narasimha, as Prahlada Varada, can be worshipped in the main temple complex at the base of the mountains, at ground level. The festival deities of many of the hill temples are also housed here, due to security and other considerations.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p>The temples built in the Dravidian style of architecture have been expanded, rebuilt, and renovated principally by the Vijayanagara rulers in the 15th and 16th century CE.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p>Up in the mountainous region, there is a cleft of a massive rock, divided somewhat into two parts. This is known as the Ugra Sthambham and is believed to be the massive pillar of demon Hiranya's palace, splitting which Lord Narasimha emerged out. Prahlada can also be worshipped in a cave not far from Ugra Sthambham along with Prahlada Narasimha Swamy. This shrine is called Prahlada Mettu. Raktha Kundam is the most sacred of the many water bodies of this place.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p>It is said that Narasimha cleaned his blood-stained hands in these waters after killing Hiranya, and that is the reason its waters are reddish in color, even now.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p><u><b>Temple Festivals</b></u><br>
  Brahmotsavam is the important festival of this shrine, celebrated during the Tamil month Masi (February-March). Lord Prahlada Varada is taken in grand processions during this 10-day festival. Swati is the birth star of Narasimha, and on the Swati star days of every month, all the 9 Narasimha deities are given ceremonial sacred baths, known as Thirumanjanam.</p>
</div>

<div class="top1">
  <p><u><b>Benefits of Worshipping Ahobilam Lord Narasimha</b></u><br>
  Narasimha is a powerful God, and Ahobilam is considered his place of advent. People seek refuge in him to ward off the negative impacts of the present difficult times of Kali Yuga. It is believed that he will help devotees gain courage, confidence, and strength, fulfill their honest wishes, and grant them the boon of a happy, healthy, and contented life.</p>
