Although horizontal and vertical lines can be drawn perfectly on bitmap screens,
and lines at 45 degrees reproduce reasonably well, lines at any other angle and curves
have ‘jaggies’, rough edges caused by the attempt to approximate the line with pixels.
When using a single color jaggies are inevitable. Similar effects are seen in bitmap
fonts. The problem of jaggies can be reduced by using high-resolution screens, or by
a technique known as anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing softens the edges of line segments,
blurring the discontinuity and making the jaggies less obvious.
