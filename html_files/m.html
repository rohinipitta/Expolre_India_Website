Mata Mansa Devi Temple at Panchkula is a symbol of Himalayan culture and faith. The shrine located on the foot hills of Shivalik is an epitome of age old tradition of ‘Shakti’ worship in northern India. Himalaya being the abode of Shiva and his consort ’shakti’ became centre of Shakti worship. In the vicinity of Panchkula there are numerous Shakti worshipping centers known by their names such as Chandi, Kalika, Mansa, Bhima etc. Hence, mythological speaking, Chandigarh-Panchkula region undoubtedly continued to be living legends of shaktism where its practices are in vogue.</p>
<p>
Maharaja Gopal Singh of Manimajra constructed the present main temple of Shri Mansa Devi during the period 1811-1815. This temple had the patronage of Manimajra State.

Unfortunately, the temples remained neglected after the princely states were merged resulting in the ending of the State Government’s patronage. This is when a pujari was appointed as the ‘khidmatuzar’ of the temple to offer prayers to the deity of the temple.</p>
<p>
Today, the temple has a marble idol of Goddess Mansa but earlier the whole ‘sand’ formed the ‘Pindi’ that encompasses Goddess Saraswati and Goddess Laxmi as well. It was this Holy ‘sand’ that was worshipped. The sparking ornaments that adorn the Goddess idol renders it even more charming and adds more spiritual appeal to it. These ornaments are especially used during festivals and pujas.
